Multi-Fibonacci Retracement Indicator
This indicator identifies swing highs and lows on a price chart and draws Fibonacci retracement levels (61.8% and 161.8%) along with trendlines between these swings. 
Key features include:

Swing Detection: Uses a fractal-based method to identify swing points, with adjustable sensitivity (FractalPeriod).
Bullish/Bearish Fibs: Draws Fibonacci levels for both upward (low-to-high) and downward (high-to-low) swings.
Customization: Allows color customization, trendline toggling, and debug logging.
Strict Confirmation: Optional close-price confirmation for swing points (StrictSwingConfirmation).
Efficiency: Limits lookback (MaxLookbackBars) and the number of drawn Fibs (MaxFibsToDraw) to avoid clutter.

Potential Development into an EA
Advantages:
Clear Rules for Entries/Exits:
Entries: Trigger trades when price touches key Fibonacci levels (e.g., 61.8%) and shows reversal patterns (e.g., pin bars, engulfing).
Exits: Use the 161.8% level for profit targets or trailing stops.
Example: Buy at 61.8% retracement of a bullish swing with RSI oversold confirmation; sell at 161.8% extension.

Trend Confirmation:
The EA could use the trendlines (DrawTrendLines) to filter trades in the direction of the trend 
(e.g., only take bullish trades if the trendline slope is positive).

Adaptability:
Adjust FractalPeriod dynamically based on volatility (e.g., higher values in ranging markets, lower in trending markets).

Disadvantages:

Lag in Swing Detection:
Fractal-based swings inherently lag, which may delay trade signals. This could be mitigated by combining with momentum indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).

Over-reliance on Fibonacci Levels:
Price may not respect Fib levels during strong trends. 
Adding volume analysis or moving averages could improve reliability.

Clutter in Ranging Markets:
Multiple Fib levels in choppy markets may generate false signals. 
A filter (e.g., ADX threshold) could avoid low-quality trades.

Suggested Enhancements for an EA:
Confluence Filters: Require additional conditions (e.g., candle patterns, volume spikes) at Fib levels.
Dynamic Risk Management: Adjust position sizes based on the distance between Fib levels (wider ranges = smaller positions).
Time-Based Expiry: Auto-close trades if price stagnates near a Fib level beyond a set period.

Summary
This indicator provides a structured way to identify key price levels, but its effectiveness as an EA depends on robust entry/exit rules 
and complementary filters to address its inherent lag and false signals.
