Volume Profile Calculation:

The indicator calculates the previous day's volume profile by aggregating volume at different price levels
It identifies the Point of Control (POC) - the price level with the highest volume
It calculates the Value Area (typically containing 70% of the day's volume) around the POC
It identifies the Profile High and Low (the highest and lowest prices with significant volume)

Trading Signal Generation:
Compares today's opening price to yesterday's volume profile levels

Generates signals:
Open above VA but below Profile High → Buy on retracement to POC
Open below VA but above Profile Low → Sell on retracement to POC
Open above Profile High → Potential upside breakout
Open below Profile Low → Potential downside breakout

Visualization:

Draws the POC as a solid blue line
Draws Value Area High/Low as green dotted lines
Draws Profile High/Low as red dotted lines
Places arrow signals at the POC when a trading opportunity exists

How to Use the Indicator
Attach the indicator to your chart (it works best on daily timeframe)

The indicator will automatically calculate yesterday's volume profile
At the start of each new day, it will analyze today's open relative to yesterday's profile

Look for:
Buy signals when price retraces to POC after opening above VA
Sell signals when price retraces to POC after opening below VA
Potential breakouts when opening outside the profile range
